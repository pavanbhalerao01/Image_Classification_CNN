# Image_Classification_CNN
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented using Python and TensorFlow/Keras to perform image classification. The project is designed to classify images from popular datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10. The CNN model is trained to recognize and categorize images into predefined classes with high accuracy
